# House-Modelling-using-Point-Cloud-Data
In this project, I have used point cloud data to model a single-story building in Revit. The Cottage.rcp file is the point cloud data, or the registered scan, which serves as the input to any BIM software like Revit. The PointCloud-Stewart_House.rvt file is the final 3D model of the house.

You can download the Cottage.rcp file and insert it into your Revit software. You will then be able to see the point cloud data. From there, you can work with the point cloud to model the house.

The uploaded files are sufficient to model a house, but if you want to model it very precisely—with accurate measurements of doors, windows, wall cuts, roof elements, etc., along with their types—you may need the LGS file of the point cloud data.

Please feel free to contact me at rishav160999@gmail.com if you would like to work with this data to design a house. I will be happy to provide you with the LGS file.

Additionally, for simplicity, I have attached a presentation guide that outlines the steps involved in modeling a house using point cloud data.
